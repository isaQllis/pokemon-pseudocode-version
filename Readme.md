### POKEMON IN PORTUGOL (VisualG)

This project was made in a collage work in the course of Programming Logic using a procedural pseudocode writed in portuguese.

This pseudocode runs only in a software called 'VisualG 3.0'.

It is a reinterpretation of Pokemon classic battles with ASCII graphics.

All the pseudocode is covered with comments to facilitate the learning of new developers.

Enjoy it!
